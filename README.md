# DEIMoS-Snakemake
I have made this to work with Sapelo2
to get this to work you must first 
ml Miniconda3/23.5.2-0
ml Anaconda3/2023.09-0
ml Mamba/23.1.0-4


When you want to get the deimos conda envirnment working you must use "mamba env create -f environment.yml". 
to activate envirnment you must use "source activate deimos"
once envirnment is active you can then run this command "pip install -e ." (might only have to do this once.
